# Java-8-Streams-MapReduce
Implemented MapReduce using Java 8 streams for Weather Station Objects. The purpose of this task is the method countTemperatures(t1,t2,r) in the class WeatherStation returns a list which contains two pairs: 1) temperature t1 paired with the number of times a temperature in the interval [t1-r..t1+r] has been measured so far by any of the weather stations in stations, and 2) temperature t2 paired with the number of times a temperature in the interval [t2-r..t2+r] has been measured so far by any of the weather stations in stations.
